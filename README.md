# Amaury Simondet - Vanilla MERN Authentication App

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

I have made what we call a MERN app for MongoDB Express React and Node ! 

This is a "vanilla" project (no design) but all the hard stuff has been made:
- Back end : 
  - Connection to a Mongo database and schemas
  - Creation of an API to send and receive from React to Node


- Front end:
  - Basic Login and Signup React components with forms using bootstrap
  - Only authenticated accessible page with a Logout button
  - Routing and private routing

## Make it work for you
- Download zip, extract anywhere then cd in it
- Create a config directory with a config.js in it and put your mongoURL and hashing secret in it like this:

`
module.exports = {
    "secret" : "example-secret",
    "mongoURL": "mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster0.naapg7h.mongodb.net/nameofDB"
}
`
- Back in cmd: `npm config set legacy-peer-deps true`
- `npm install`

You are all set now:
- `npm start` in the root directory (to run the API and mongo connection)
- `npm start` in the client directory (for the front end)

But I had to make it work in 2022
